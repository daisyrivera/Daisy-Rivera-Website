        <div class="subheading mb-5">SociologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Daisy Rivera. I am a third year
        undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside.
        Currently, I am pursuing a B.A. in Sociology. I graduated from El Monte High
        School in El Monte California in June 2017. I plan on entering graduate school 
        upon graduation from UCR to pursue my Master's and I am currently looking for an
        internship with anything that involves therapy. One of my favorite hobbies would 
        definitely be playing my acoustic guitar, it relieves a lot of my stress and gives 
        me peace of mind. Apart from the guitar, I also play the violin and was the first 
        chair in my high school orchestra for three years. Another hobby I truly enjoy 
        would be cooking with my mother. We cook traditional mexican food and whenever I 
        come back to my apartment in Riverside I remake whatever it is we cooked together 
        which is always very comforting to my soul since I am away from home. I 
        absolutely love to travel, my favorite vacation spot is Guadalajara, Jalisco
        which is my motherâ€™s hometown in Mexico. Traveling is an important part of my 
        life and I plan on visiting many parts of the world as the years pass by.<br><br>

        Before entering UC Riverside, I worked as a full-time cashier and waitress at a 
        restaurant in my hometown. I have about a year worth of experience in being a 
        cashier and waitress. I also tutored elementary and middle school students for 
        about three years while I was in high school all while working and taking advanced 
        placement classes. For the past three summers I have worked at my uncleâ€™s furniture 
        business as a secretary which deals with making sales and doing paperwork for the 
        company. This job has given me a lot of experience in the business industry since 
        I have worked close hand with closing international deals that involve the sale of 
        furniture. I plan on continuing this job with my uncle during this upcoming summer 
        as well to be able to obtain much more experience.<br><br>

        Currently I am part of a student organization on campus called Student Association 
        of Latino Spanish Affairs which I have been a part of for about a year now. I am fluent 
        in both Spanish and English, one of my upcoming goals is to study abroad in Mexico and 
        possibly attain my P.h.D there in the next few years after obtaining my Masterâ€™s at 
        UC Riverside. I am also currently learning French, I would say I am pretty proficient 
        at this point and wish to continue to learn many more new languages in order to become 
        a certified translator.
